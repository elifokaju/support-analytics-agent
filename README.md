# Support Analytics Agent

Answer questions about support ticket data by combining SQL queries with natural language interpretation.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add elifokaju/support-analytics-agent
```

Works with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), [Cursor](https://cursor.com), [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf), and [40+ other AI coding agents](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills).

## Usage

After installing, ask questions like:

- "What are the top issues this week?"
- "How long does it take to resolve tickets?"
- "Which agent has the heaviest workload?"
- "Give me a summary I can share with the team"

The agent queries the SQLite database and interprets results with actionable insights.
